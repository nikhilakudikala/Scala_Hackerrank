Problem:

Given a list, repeat each element in the list n amount of times. The input and output portions will be handled automatically by the grader.
You need to write a function with the recommended method signature.

Input Format:

The first line contains the integer S where S is the number of times you need to repeat the elements. 
The next X lines each contain an integer. These are the X elements in the array.

Output Format:

Output each element of the original list S times, each on a separate line. 
You have to return the list/vector/array of S * X integers. The relative positions of the values should be the same as the original list provided in the input.
